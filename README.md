RSVP was a begineer project to familarize myself with the Firebase set-up and features. The steps to this project were provided by the Google Firebase codelab [here](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-get-to-know-web#0). Hints were provided. Instructions on how to create and set-up a Firebase account were included in the steps.
